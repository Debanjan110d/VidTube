1. npm init --y // -y means yes to all questions(Do not forget to change the type form "common" to "module" in the package.json file)
2. npm i -d // Means download dependencies
3. npm i -D // Means download dev dependencies 
 in this you should install nodemon and prettier
    nodemon: for live server and continously refresh it automatically
    prettier: for code formatting (create a " .prettierrc " file in the root directory  ; its a rc file)
            in this file you can write your code formatting preferences like 
            {
                "singleQuote": false,
                "bracketSpacing": true,
                "tabWidth": 2,
                "trailingComma": "es5",
                "semi": true
            }
        then create prettierignore file in the root directory(this file is used to ignore files that are not to be formatted)
            in this file you can write the name of the files that are not to be formatted like:
                /.vscode
                /node_modules
                ./distribution


                *.env
                .env
                .env.*
                notes.txt
4.create src folder in the root directory
5. Then run this command(Try to use bash terminal) to create all the folders in src:
    cd src
    mkdir controllers db middlewares models routes utils
6.Then create some files in src :(using touch command):
     touch app.js index.js constants.js .env .env.sample
